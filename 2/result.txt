Title: Logout Button Non-Functional in Safari Browser
Description
The logout button on the application does not respond when clicked in the Safari browser. This prevents users from safely ending their sessions, potentially leading to security risks.

Steps to Reproduce
Open the application in Safari (version [X.Y.Z if known]).

Log in with valid credentials.

Click the Logout button.

Observe no action is taken (no redirect, no session termination).

Actual Behavior vs. Expected Behavior
Actual Behavior: Logout button is unresponsive; session remains active.

Expected Behavior: Clicking the button should terminate the session and redirect to the login page.

Environments
Affected: Safari (Desktop/iOS) [Specify versions if confirmed].

Not Affected: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (verified in versions [X.Y.Z]).

Severity/Impact
Severity: High (core security functionality broken for Safari users).

Impact: Users cannot log out, risking unauthorized access to accounts.

Acceptance Criteria for QA Team
Logout button in Safari must terminate the session and redirect to the login page.

No console errors or warnings during the process.

Regression testing confirms no impact on other browsers.
